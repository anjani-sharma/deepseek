## üîç Project Context
This implementation emerges from a critical examination of AI privacy concerns in modern development. While major AI platforms offer powerful capabilities, they often require data transmission to external servers - a fundamental privacy concern for many organizations and developers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
- Core AI: DeepSeek R1 model (1.5B parameters)
- Local Deployment: OLLAMA framework
- Framework: Langchain
- Interface: Streamlit
- Architecture: Privacy-centric, offline-capable

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Install OLLAMA
2. Clone repository
3. Setup environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## üîë Key Features
- Complete privacy: All processing happens locally on your machine
- No data sharing with external servers
- Works offline once model is downloaded
- Custom UI with Streamlit
- Flexible model selection
- Chat history management
- Temperature controls for response creativity


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
1. Install OLLAMA on your machine
2. Clone this repository
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```python
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install requirements:
   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the application:
   ```python
   streamlit run app.py
